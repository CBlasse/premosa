<h2>Detailed Description</h2>
<p>
The idea of a watershed partition of an image is well established and informally appeals
to exactly the idea of a watershed in nature, i.e. a region for which all rain drops
landing in the region flow to the same minimum basin.  Proceeding more formally, a
<B>minimum</B> is a connected set of voxels of the same value for which every adjacent voxel
not in the set has a greater value.  In a watershed partition, there is a <B>catchment
basin</B> enclosing each minimum, that is the connected set of all voxels for
which there is a connected path to its minimum along which values do
not increase (a rain drop flows downhill to the minimum).  For continuous domains this
definition would suffice, but for integer valued domains there is the problem of ties which is
solved in the algorithm of Vincent and Soile (<I>IEEE Trans. on Pat. Analysis &amp; Mach. Learning</I>
13, 6 (1991)), by having the water flow to the geodesically closer basin.  A
<B>watershed partition</B> is a set of non-overlapping catchment basins that cover the entire
image.
</p>
<a name="catchment basin"><a>
<a name="dam"><a>
<p>
A watershed partition of a <I>UINT8_</I> or <I>UINT16_TYPE</I> array or slice <I>image</I>, using a variant
of the algorithm of Vincent and Soille, is generated by <a href="Watershed.html#Build_Watershed">Build_Watershed</a>.  The partition is
returned as a <a href="Partition.html">Partition</a> object whose label array is a coloring of the watershed in the smallest
type (UINT8, UINT16, or UINT32) that accommodates the number of colors in the labeling.
A current important
limitation is that the routine restricts the size of <I>image</I> to 2<sup>31</sup>-1.  Note
carefully that as a consequence all indices on this page are simply of type <I>int</I>, as opposed
to the <I>int64</I> required in the rest of the library.  The routine consumes 4 bytes per voxel in
working storage along with two integer stacks whose size is generally a small fraction of the
image size.  In the future the 32-bit limitation on size will be removed as large memories
continue to become less expensive and more common place.
</p>
<p>
<I>Build_Watershed</I> can actually be broken down into two distinct parts.  In the first part
of the process, a label field of the watershed partition of the image is built in a UINT32_TYPE
<a href="Partition.html#Label_Array">Label_Array</a> of the same shape as the image or its underlying array wherein the pixels of
catchment basin <I>i</I> are labeled with <I>i+1</I> for <I>i &isin; [0,nbasins-1]</I>.  This is
accomplished with a call to <a href="Watershed.html#Label_Watershed">Label_Watershed</a>.  In the second phase, a <a href="Partition.html">Partition</a> object
is produced by calling <a href="Partition.html#Make_Partition">Make_Partition</a> (described in the <a href="Partition.html">Partition</a> class page) with the
watershed labeling produced in the first step.
In fact, the entire <a href="Partition.html">Partition</a> class was initially developed for watersheds and was later
identified as an independently useful concept.
The depth of a <a href="Partition.html#P_Vertex">P_Vertex</a> is the value of its catchment basin minimum, and
the height of an <a href="Partition.html#P_Edge">P_Edge</a> is the height of the dam or ridge that separates two catchment basins of
the watershed.  Thus one can get a basic representation of a
watershed partition in the label field array if that is all one desires, or one can further
build a <a href="Partition.html">Partition</a> graph for the watershed decomposition.  We illustrate this by giving
the code for <a href="Watershed.html#Build_Watershed">Build_Watershed</a>.
</p>
<pre>
 Partition *Build_Watershed(Pixel_APart *image, boolean iscon2n, boolean color)
 { Label_Array *h;
   Partition   *s;
   int          n;

   h = Make_Array_With_Shape(PLAIN_KIND,INT32_TYPE,AForm_Shape(image));
   Label_Watershed(image,h,&n,iscon2n);
   s = Make_Partition(image,h,n,iscon2n,color);
   if (Get_Partition_Color_Count(s) < 256)
     Convert_Array_Inplae(h,PLAIN_KIND,UINT8_TYPE,8,0);
   else if (Get_Partition_Color_Count(s) < 0x10000)
     Convert_Array_Inplae(h,PLAIN_KIND,UINT16_TYPE,16,0);
   Pack_Array(h);
   return (s);
 }
</pre>
<p>
The watershed algorithm tends to oversegment an image as it is very sensitive to small
fluctuations in signal.  One approach is to smooth the image with a Gaussian filter prior
to applying the watershed, but a far superior approach is to progressively merge watersheds
for which the difference between their depth and the dam height separating them is small.
To faciliatate this the <a href="Partition.html">Partition</a> class has routines that allow one to progressively merge
regions in either the fixed order of dam height (<a href="Partition.html#Static_Collapse">Static_Collapse</a>), or more flexibly in
any dynamic order defined by the user (<a href="Partition.html#General_Collapse">General_Collapse</a>).  For example, for a watershed
partition <I>w</I>, the routine <a href="Watershed.html#Average_Watershed_Heights">Average_Watershed_Heights</a>
fills in vectors <I>num</I> and <I>den</I> of length <I>Get_Partition_Edge_Count(p)</I> so that for the
<i>j<sup>th</sup></i> edge,
<I>num[j]</I> is the sum of the pixel values along the boundary separating the two basins,
<I>den[j]</I> is the number of pixels in along the boundary, and therefore
<I>num[j]/den[j]</I> is the average dam height of the boundary separating the two regions
of the edge.  In addition, if <I>sqr</I> is not NULL, then upon return <I>sqr[j]</I> contains the
sum of the square of each pixel value along the boundary separating the two basins, so that
from this one can compute the variance and standard deviation of pixels along a boundary
if desired.  Moreover, pixels of value <I>null</I> are not included in the sums and counts, allowing
one to mask certain pixels if desired (otherwise pick <I>null</I> to be out of the range of values
in the image).
The average dam height between two basins may be a more useful measure of separability in
cases where there are
'weaknesses' in the barrier, such as irregularly stained biological boundaries.
One may then wish to collapse basins (regions) in order of average dam height, where a little
thought reveals that average dam height changes as basins are merged, because this implies
dams (boundaries) must also be merged.  A complete example of such a merging using the
values provided by <a href="Watershed.html#Average_Watershed_Heights">Average_Watershed_Heights</a> can be found
<a href="Partition.html#aveheight">here</a>.

Compute the watershed partition of the <I>UINT8_</I> or <I>UINT16_TYPE</I> array or slice <I>image</I>

using a variant of the algorithm of Vincent and Soille, and generate a <a href="Partition.html">Partition</a> object

label array is a coloring iff <I>color</I> is true.  A
current important limitation of the Partition class is that this routine restricts the
size of <I>image</I> to 2<sup>31</sup>-1.  Note carefully that as a consequence all indices
for this class are simply of type <I>int</I>, as opposed to the <I>int64</I> required in the rest of

the 32-bit limitation on size will be removed as large memories continue to become

Produce a label field of the watershed partition of <I>image</I> in the supplied integer array
<I>labels</I> with respect to the connectivity indicated by <I>iscon2n</I>.
That is, in the integer array <I>labels</I>, the pixels of catchment basin <I>i</I>
are labeled with <I>i+1</I> for <I>i &isin; [0,nbasins-1]</I>.  The number of basins is returned
in <I>nbasins</I>.  This label field is in effect a watershed partitioning.  This label field,
can be used to produce a <a href="Partition.html">Partition</a> graph by <a href="Partition.html#Make_Partition">Make_Partition</a>.
</p>
<p>
If <I>image</I> is an array, then <I>labels</I> must have the same shape as <I>image</I>.  On the otherhand,
if <I>image</I> is a slice of an array, then <I>labels</I> may have either the shape of the slice or
the shape of the array of the slice.  In the latter case, the routine only accesses the pixels
of <I>labels</I> corresponding to the pixels of the slice, thus permitting one to compute the
watersheds of disjoint slices that cover an array in different threads that share a single
label field.  This is about 15% more efficient than having each slice use its own label
field (proportional to the size of the slice) due to the indexing issues involved with
correlating traversals in arrays of two different sizes.

Compute the average watershed height between any two adjacent basins. The caller supplies
