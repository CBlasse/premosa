  This is a C-library under continual expansion and development by Gene Myers.  It is
licensed under the copyright notice at the end of this file and currently consists
of 19 modules, supporting a total of 19 classes, with 400+ routines:

  FOR IMAGE_ANALYSIS:

    array.[ph]
        An array abstraction and basic primitives for making and operating upon them.
        Includes support for the concepts of slices and frames that are mechanisms for
        conveniently working with subarrays of an array.

    image.[ph]
        A library for reading and writing images between .tif files and arrays.  The latest
        version uses the MY-TIFF package so the library no longer relies on TiffLib 6.0.

    flood.fill.[ph]
        Basic routines to support 2n- and 3^n-conectivity and flood-filling of volumes and surfaces.

    filters.[ph]
        Routines to convolve arrays with filter elements, compute gradients, curvature, and
        other transforms of an array/image (such as flow fields, Laplacian, and distance transform)
        (IN_PROGRESS: gradients & curvature)

    histogram.[ph]
         Generator of histograms of arrays that can then be used to compute statistics,
         thresholds, entropy, and so on.

    level.set.[ph]
        The level-set tree data abstraction (for arrays of any dimensionality)

    water.shed.[ph]
        The watershed partition abstraction (for arrays of any dimensionality).

    region.[ph]
        An abstraction for connected objects that records them via their surface.

    draw.[ph]
        Routines to draw a variety of shapes, contours, water-sheds, level-sets, etc.
        on an array.  The concept of brushes for the different kinds of arrays is supported.

    tiff_image, tiff_io -- a replacement for libtiff.  Reads, writes and interprets almost
                           any tiff (save those for fax and print media).

    swc.[ph]
        Routines to support .swc formated trees modeling neurons.  Read/write, creation,
        addition, clipping, extents, path length, etc.

    paths.[ph]
        Routines for computing shortest paths between sets of source and destination points.

    snake.[ph]
        Active contours as an (n-1) hyperplane in n-dimensions (IN_PROGRESS)
        normalized correlation.  Uses the MY-FFT package.

  FOR NUMERICAL ANALYSIS:

    fft.[ph]
        Routines for real, complex 1- and multi-dimensional FFTs, convolutions, correlations,
        and normalized correlations in floating point and double precision.

    linear.algebra.[ph]
        Routines for inverting matrices, determinants, and solving systems of
        linear equations based on the lu-decomposition (with partial pivoting).
        Also tri-diagonal and penta-diagonal matrix solvers with applications
        to cubic splines and active contours.

    fct.min.[ph]
        Routines to minimize functions of one or more variables

    fct.root.[ph]
        Routines to find roots of functions of one or more variables

  GENERAL:

    utilities.[ph]
        A few guarded system calls and a spiffy command-line interpretation utility,
        documented in detail in the file Command.Line.pdf

    hash.[ph]
        A hash table abstraction

    cdf.[ph]
        A suite of routines for generating random variables from a suite of well-known
        probability distributions

    svg.[ph]
        Routines for creating an "svg" drawing.  I find it very useful for program
        animation or generation of complex visual displays.  SVG is an xml-based drawing
        specification that can be displayed by browsers and a number of free-ware drawing
        packages.

Most of the modules are fairly stable although I won't warrant that they are bug free.
All have been tested fairly methodically and most have been used often and so are fairly
well exercised, particularly the general utilities.

  Documentation for the library currently consists of a collection of html pages that can
be accessed by opening HTML/AllPages.html in the browser of your choosing.  In addition,
there are a couple of .pdf documents in the subfolder PDFS describing (a) the object
management scheme central to the library (Object.Management.pdf), and (b) a command line
interpretor that allows you to easily specify complex command lines, yet easily interpret
them (Command.Line.pdf).

  As just mentioned the library use a fairly sophisticated object management scheme.
To facilitate developement and avoid writing boring stylized code over and over again,
I developed a special preprocessor that generates most of the code for this object management
(it is documented in the file PDFS/Object.Management.pdf).  Therefore the source for every
module is in a .p (*not* for pascal!) file that is transformed into a .c file by the
preprocessor built by compiling generator.c (see BUILDME for instructions on how to make
the library).

  Similarly, I found that to handle arrays of different types, or an enum of operation types,
and so on, that a sytlized macro expansion around the idea of a generator gave much more
readable and terser code than using the C macro-preprocessor.  This is also realized as part
of the mylib preprocessor that is invoked on all the .p files.  This simple generator is
described in the comments that head the C file, generator.c, implementing it.

  Most of the routines handle arrays/images that have more than 2 billion elements/pixels.
Any individual dimension must be less than 2 billion but the total size of the array can
be larger.  The restrictions are that the level set and water shed routines do not handle
arrays of such sizes, the reason being that the working storage would double and so be
unlikely to fit in the memory of a machine unless it has on the order of 64Gb or more.

  As of February, 2011, the library is thread-safe and many of the routines work on array
slices making it easy to write parallel thread code with the library.
