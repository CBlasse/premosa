  This is a basic C-code library for fast fourier transforms.  It provides the following
functionality:

  1 Forward and inverse FFT of complex arrays, in place.

  2 Forward and inverse FFT of real arrays, in place.

  3 Convolution and correlation of real and complex arrays.

  4 Routines are provided that handle the case of multi-dimensional arrays with
      an arbitrary number of dimensions.  Separate routine interfaces are provided
      for the case of one-dimensional arrays as this case can be further optimized.

  5 Routines are provided for floating point and double precision numbers.

  6 Optimizations for the Intel processor SSE3 hardware capabilities can be compiled in.

  7 The code is re-entrant and hence can be threaded.

  Space is often at a premium.  The routines for the FFT of real arrays take half the
space and unlike the code in say, Numerical Recipes, take advantage of the symmetries
of the transform to work in place.  To further improve space performance floating point
as opposed to double precision routines are also provided, saving another half in space.
The numerical stability of the floating point versions is significantly "weaker" than for
the double precision case, but the routines are twice as fast, and as long as the numbers
under consideration are not too large (e.g. [0,255.]) the stability is more than good
enough for correlation and convolution maximization problems.

  The routines will handle multi-dimensional arrays that are over 2Gb in size on 64-bit
machines.  Each individual dimension must fit in a signed integer, but the total size
of the array, i.e. the product of its dimensions, may be as large as 2^63.

  The codes only work for powers of 2 at the current time.  For these values the codes
are competitive (+ or - 10% in run time) with the FFTW package for any power of 2.
The FFTW package is considered the best open-source FFT package available.  The advantage
of our library is that it is simple enough that you can actually look "under the hood",
it is a heck of a lot less code, and yet it does just as well.  This code proves the
point that if you optimize a handful of things that are important, then you get nearly
optimal performance.  The complex code generator and compiler-compiler of FFTW is buying
one almost nothing over a set of intelligently selected hand-optimizations.

  The library consists of two modules fft.F.c and fft.D.c with their associated .h files,
fft.F.h and fft.D.h.  The "F" .c,.h pair realizes a floating point interface and the
"D" .c,.h pair realizes a double precision interface.  They can both be linked in to your
application (as their externally visible names are distinct), but if you just need one or
the other precision then you need only link in the relevant .o file.

  Saying "make" at the command line compiles fft.F.o, fft.D.o, and myfft.o (which contains
both interfaces in a single .o).  Link in the appropriate one to your application.
The make file gives the -msse3 option to the gcc compiler which instructs it to use the
Intel SSE3 instruction optimizations.  This option will not work on any other type of
chip (e.g. AMD) and needs to be edited or commented out for such architectures.

  Saying "make test" builds and runs a suite of test routines that make sure everything is
fine with the build on your machine.  It should be obvious when something is wrong.

  Saying "make package" builds a compressed tarball of the package for export to
another system.

  The interface is documented in detail in each of the two .h files.  The documentation
of the code itself is OK, but probably not fully explanatory save to someone expert on
the subject of FFTs.
